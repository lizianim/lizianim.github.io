                Crashing onto the earth's surface a meteorite is the smallest part of a galaxy, making sure we remember it. The crater is temporary; the memory of a universe is embedded within the material. People have always loved metal, and they loved stories even more. Humanity takes a meteorite and immortalises themselves into its signature â€” a hard drive is talking only when we feel it out. Who are we if we do not try to read everything we find?
