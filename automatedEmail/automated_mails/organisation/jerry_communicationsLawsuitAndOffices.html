        <p>
            Jerry here,<br>
            This is the communications and Lawsuit thread!
            <br><br>
            Thank you for finding your way here, I appreciate your dedication to find a peaceful solution.<br>
            Let’s begin with a few exercises:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Ask yourself:  What are you grateful for today?</li>
            <li>Search inside yourself: How are you feeling: Are there any negative emotions? Are you happy? Satisfied? Sad?</li>
            <li>Take a breath: Let the moment happen. Stay like this for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Be honest: How much does this Lawsuit stress you? Are you really angry at the opposite offices, or are you just mad that you have been stressed / hurt?</li>
            <li>Accept the truth: Sometimes it’s hard to accept that the office opposite of yours is also a human, just like you. Accepting this fact is not only the first step to feeling better, but you will also soon recognize an inner peace inside of yourself, wishing to let go of the lawsuit entirely.</li>
            <li>Come back to the present: You are in the office, back in work time, in front of your computer. You are calm. You are a person. Everything will be settled.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Thank you for joining!
            <br><br>
            Now to the important bits:<br>
            I have been notified that there is a bit of a confusion going on with the lawsuit filing number, which is unfortunate.
            <br><br>
            I am in direct contact with finance, and they notified me that should any employee need the number, I can refer them to the correct mail:
            <br><br>
            Please include the lawsuit, filing number request and my name in the subject, and you should be able to get to the correct lawsuit -> it is important to mention "watercooler incident lawsuit" in the reference, they need to know WHAT lawsuit you are referring to.
            <br><br>
            Stay civil!<br>
            Jerry
