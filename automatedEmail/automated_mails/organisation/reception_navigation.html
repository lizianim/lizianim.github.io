        <p>
            Hello and welcome!<br>
            If you read this, that means you are in need of some navigational help.<br>
            <br>
            Here are a few reminders:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>We all use the same email (except newcomers)</li>
            <li>
                The offices are currently under automation restructure, meaning you will get sorted into the respectful folder your email may be filtered into.<br>
                From here on the corresponding office will respond to you.
            </li>
            <li>
                If you need help or get lost: Put "secretary help" into the subject, and you will come to the secretaryâ€™s office. - she will redirect you to me again.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            As for my opinion:<br>
    Try to write HR offices a quick email, they seem to be the ones responding to almost any email.
        </p>
        <p>
            I hope I could help you and wish you well.<br>
            In the name of SpareCorp Incorporated, thank you for your time and efforts, and hope to hear from you soon!
        </p>
