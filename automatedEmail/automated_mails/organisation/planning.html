            reminder,<br>
            we are currently in a lawsuit offensive with those idiots from project -
            I sure hope they didn't send you because we can and will make your life hell.
            <br><br>
            If you want to join our cause, and beat projects pathetic ass, you know how to reach our thread; if not ask Jerry, so he makes himself useful for once, instead of trying to make us and project kiss and hug.
            <br<<br>
            If there is anything else, we don't care, as you know, we had our watercoolers stolen, sabotaged and even lost some of our office, as embarrassing as it is to actually write this, project team might be a bunch of wimps, but they sure have teeth that bite down.
            <br><br>
            Oh also, what the fuck is it with this server only sending and receiving automated mails? I literally have to make so many settings, just to not lose or be flooded with stupid mails. If it weren't for my paycheck, I would have already found that rat out that did this.
            <br><br>
            You know what actually,<br>
            I will do something right now. Fuck this place.
            Fuck<br>
            every<br>
            single<br>
            one<br>
            of you!!!!<br>
            Who the fuck do you think you are??? Actually no, who the fuck do you think WE ARE???
            If you want to ACTUALLY talk to us, reach us at lowest priority. wait your fucking turn. Wallow in the knowledge that some FUCKING IDIOT decided to be smart (I bet its Project) and mess with the servers. AGAIN. 
            <br><br>
            And just because we are NOT a bunch of Nerds hanging out in the fucking server rooms, talking to plants and drinking organic mint tea you think you can fucking mess with us? I think. the fuck. not.
            <br><br>
            No, IF you come from Project, forget it. We will not respond.
            No. We refuse. Ask Jerry. We don't care anymore, FUCK these guys, and FUCK you as well. I'll go get some fucking coffee from finance and get my cooler water from there, at least they respect us, as they FUCKING should.
            <br><br>
            Fuck off,<br>
            Planning.
