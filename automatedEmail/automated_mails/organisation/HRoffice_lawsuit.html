            Jerry here,<br>
            This mail is reaching you if you are directly involved in the lawsuit regarding water cooler preferences between planning and the project team.
            <br><br>
            As of this date, the lawsuit is going on for 2 Weeks, and both parties - Project and Planning - have not settled yet or concluded.<br>
            Due to internal policies, we are required to call in two external lawyers, which has not happened yet, as we are experiencing issues with our email servers.<br>
            In the meantime, I see it as important to both inform everyone involved about the situation, and talk about a possible resolution, while we wait for our emails to work properly again.
            <br><br>
            To begin with, you can refer to the respected offices statements, they will have it mentioned in their own threads.<br>
            However, if you are interested in a more in-depth description and also our communications de-escalation program, I have a thread prepared:<br>
            Please reply with the following subject "communications lawsuit and offices”.
            <br><br>
            On a final note: I will also not be able to respond to emails that are not addressing me or anything in the body, that’s not productive. I believe in personal connection, so if you want to discuss matters like slashing some water coolers or setting someone from project on fire, Ask Nicely such as: “dear Jerry, please help me overcome my violent urges. Thanks!”
            <br><br>
            Stay civil!<br>
            Jerry
