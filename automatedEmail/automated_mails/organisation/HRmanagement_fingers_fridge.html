            Dear fellow Employee,<br>
            What a weird request.<br>
            But I saw it already coming, that's why I made this response in the first place didn't I?
            <br><br>
            Let’s begin to set the scene:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>It's late night (23:00),</li>
            <li>I am the last one in office, filing the last papers,</li>
            <li>I go to the kitchen, to grab myself a snack,</li>
            <li>
                the fridge.<br>
                Mouldy, old, and disgusting, I complain internally about lazy employees, but then again, I also cannot recall my last lunch I have put in here.<br>
                Is it still there?<br>
                Am I one of them?<br>
            </li>
            <li>
                While I ponder over this, I realize something. Why is it making such strange noises?<br>
                Like a growling, almost dangerous.
            </li>
            <li>This is where I made a mistake.</li>
            <li>I got too curious, I had to see what was inside of it, what was making these sounds.</li>
            <li>Before I could even know what to do with myself, the door was opening, something grabbed my hand, and here I am with only 4 fingers on my right hand.</li>
            <li>Now, what does that say about the situation? What does that say about me?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            That was a rhetorical question, of course.
            <br><br>
            What I mean to say:<br>
            I have no clue what this thing is, but considering it literally bit off my fingers, we should at least keep it satisfied.
            <br><br>
            Removing it is out of the question, where would we even take it?<br>
            Also, I'm sorry but after realizing its an actual living thing, there is no way I am not going to let this specimen go...
            <br><br>
            This is all you wanted to hear from me, no?<br>
            Let’s make it official: Keeping the fridge in our offices and using it as a test subject is HRs main objective. And we aim to convince the other offices to see the benefits of this arrangement.<br>
            Imagine the interpersonal research we can conduct with this! No, this is too important to just throw away. Do not let my sacrifice come to waste, fellow employees!
            <br><br>
            We'll hear from each other,<br>
            HR management.
