            reminder,<br>
            For your and my patience, I will say this here and only here.
            Since we have these automated responses, we might as well fucking use them.
            <br><br>
            Jerry: You can fuck off with your counsellor bullshit, we don't care. We want our team and our fucking coolers back. Whatever whining project is doing, WE DO NOT CARE. It's their fault they fuck around and blow up every cooler and coffee machine in the first place, so that IS THE ONLY REASON why they have their coolers. When they start acting like grownups, we would actually give them the more expensive coolers as well, but as we are not particularly interested in justifying every fucking payment of a NEW cooler EVERY FUCKING WEEK to finance, we decided to just hand out the old ones. 
            <br><br>
            And TECHNICALLY THEY DID START ALL OF THIS. As if they didn't manipulate our BRAND-NEW cooler right next to the main office to only give out cold water. Do you know how ridiculous it is to drink soggy, sad, cold, water? We're not hipsters. We want hot water. They even said its their fault! 
            "Next time you find yourself surrounded by water, look around you and see who you have drowned."
            <br><br>
            Who says shit like this? Since when do we employ poets? Itâ€™s ridiculous!
            <br><br>
            Also, Why the fuck is everyone messing up the lawsuit number?
            As Jerry said, finance probably has it.
            DON'T file us with this stupid lawsuit sales and accounting had going on, it's embarrassing even thinking about them fighting over who has the best cold brew in the office. We do not want to be associated with this!
            <br><br>
            Fuck off,<br>
            Planning.
