            <li>From: COO</li>
            <li>To: employee</li>

        <p>
            Employee,
            As I have received this email WITHOUT THE SPECIFIED information, I will repeat it here. AGAIN. For everyone.
            <br><br>
            I WILL NOT send you the boss' email without the information. I will not do it. I did it before, it ended terribly, we had to rehash our servers, they were even more fucked up than last time. And more importantly, I had to delete 1000s of fucking application letters manually because the server was broken. This is not my job. My job is to make you do things. Not the other way around.
            <br><br>
            IF you need the boss' email, for some reason, this is how it goes:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Send me the name of "the fridge‚Äù</li>
            <li>Send me the internal lawsuit reference number</li>
            <li>Send me the copy-machine intelligence password</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            BEFORE you ask, NO I DO NOT know where to get this information. That is WHY I ask in the first place. Again: You do the work; I make sure everything is all right here. I can't risk another catastrophic snowballing of weird internal affairs, SO DO YOUR JOB AND FOR OUR SAKE KEEP IT CONFIDENTIAL
            (I do not need anyone in this forsaken office to know every little detail of our operations.)
            <br><br>
            I am not getting paid to just sit around. I am getting paid to sit around AND be paranoid, so go off, do your work, and come back when you have the information.
            <br><br>
            signed,<br>
            COO.
