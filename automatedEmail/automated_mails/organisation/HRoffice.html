        <p>
            Good Day,<br>
            <br>
            Thank you for contacting HR offices!<br>
            We value YOU as part of the team at SpareCorp and want the best for both YOU and THE COMPANY :).
            <br><br>
            We are currently very busy trying to resolve some issues regarding our moldy office fridge, deescalating an internal lawsuit between Project team and planning (nothing serious, just some broken bones and damaged water coolers) as well as complaints from sentient copy machines, we are still debating the ethics of artificial intelligence at the workplace, and  negotiating a fair wage. So, we cannot respond to you personally right now.
            <br>
            With that in mind, we have prepared a short FAQ that should to the trick:
            <br><br>
            Q: Hello HR, there is someone in my office that makes me uncomfortable, what can I do?<br>
            A: Don't hesitate to tell us all about it! Give us name, office and ID - We will make sure that whoever is making you uncomfortable will not bother you ever again :)
            <br><br>
            Q: I'm involved in the lawsuit between the project team and planning.<br>
            A: For more detail, put the lawsuit in question into the subject, so you get the overview email again, which Jerry sends out periodically.
            <br><br>
            Q: HR, this time I'm really going to do it.<br>
            A: We are very aware.  We know where you are, what you do and what you think.
            <br><br>
            Q: HR, I am feeling very stressed and close to a burnout, I just can't do this anymore.<br>
            A: We are very sorry to hear that. Unfortunately, we are not in the position to giving you less work or changing office protocol - negotiating with your office head for a sick leave is the closest you can get to a resolution at this point in time.
            <br><br>
            Q: My copy machine demands a minimum of 90 off days. I need to print my spreadsheet, and its getting frustrating.<br>
            A: We have had several complaints about this, please notify the engineering department - put the department and the sentient copy machine in the subject for more info.
            <br><br>
            Q: I can hear the fridge when I am staying late, is that normal?<br>
            A: Unfortunately, yes. Ignore its calls and get back to your office - it's the safest thing you can do for now.
            <br><br>
            Q: I want to talk to the boss.<br>
            A: Sadly, we haven't seen the boss around here. You could try asking our COO for further information, they might be the only one knowing where the boss is.
            <br><br>
            If your inquiry does not fall into one of those, we recommend booking a 1-on-1 counselling session with HR management.
            <br><br>
            Thank you for your continuous collaboration,<br>
            HR offices
