            Hello and welcome!
        </p>
        <p>
            Hereby I officially welcome you to your new position at SpareCorp Incorporated!
        </p>
        <p>
            Due to your request of speaking to the CEO for important manners I have to inform you that I am currently not in the position to provide you with his email - generally only higher-level employees have the actual email the boss responds to.<br>
            <br>
            (Meaning: COO, CFO, CTO and CMO)
        </p>
        <p>
            You could try to get to higher offices and ask there for contacting leading positions if your inquiry is important. I personally would start asking HR office but itâ€™s up to you.<br>
            Make sure to use this email address: <a href="mailto:sparecorp@outlook.com">sparecorp@outlook.com</a> always, and address the offices you want to inquire on.<br>
            <br>
            Some tips for your start in the company:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>We all use the same email address</li>
            <li>
                The offices are currently under automation restructure as the server is a mess, meaning you will get sorted into the respectful folder your email may be filtered into - from here on the corresponding office will respond to you.
            </li>
            <li>
                If you need help or get lost: Try asking for reception navigation or secretary help.
            </li>
            <li>
                Be clear in spelling and caps, the server is precise.
            </li>
            <li>Core requirements: SUBJECT</li>
            <li>Some ask: BODY</li>
            <li>Higher Levels: IMPORTANCE</li>
            <li>And: SENSITIVITY</li>
            <li>Pay close attention, the offices tend to hide their requirements in the messages</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            I wish you a great start into your first workday and welcome you again to our amazing team!
        </p>
        <p>
            Best wishes,<br>
            Reception
