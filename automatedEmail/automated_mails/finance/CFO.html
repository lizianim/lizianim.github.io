        <p>
            For reference,<br>
            I am only in charge of the sensitive lawsuits, but I need to be informed of
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>The lawsuit</li>
            <li>The name of lawsuit</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            This is to both keep both parties involved with the lawsuit from tearing finance apart (we already have too little staff dealing with the horrid financial decisions done by this company) and also because I need to be in the loop regarding new lawyers, should they ever be commissioned.
            <br><br>
            regards,<br>
            CFO
