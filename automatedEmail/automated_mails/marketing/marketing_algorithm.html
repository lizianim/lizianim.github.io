            this is our last chance,<br>
            the algorithm is not inside the machine,<br>
            it is the machine,<br>
            the system<br>
            the network
            <br><br>
            it determines everything, before we can even see.<br>
            Maybe this is what we were made to do?
            <br><br>
            What are we doing?
            <br><br>
            Never mind that, this is a marketing pitch, not philosophy class, get it together!
            <br><br>
            Chain Email - the algorithm responds like a network of strangers,<br>
            making everyone part of it, without them even knowing.
            <br><br>
            Do you know how many times we died inside of the system while you saw the email fly away? I don't think it's more than five.
            <br><br>
            I will coach, but only when you choose a chain and I am in the CC:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>find a topic that you love</li>
            <li>write the topic, how you feel, what you would say about a friend, what the void looks like, your name and your favorite food on paper, give them numbers 1-5</li>
            <li>roll a dice 5 times, and note the words in that order</li>
            <li>Fill them into the template and send them to 5 fellows:</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
