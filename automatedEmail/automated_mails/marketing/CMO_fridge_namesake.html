            Good Day,<br>
            As we all know, if we want to sell, we need to incite.
            <br><br>
            In this case, I don't believe that anyone from finance will be of help, project is busy with their internal debates if its even ethical to call the fridge pet. We, however could change the company forever with just a little brainstorming, design and lots. of. marketing.
            <br><br>
            as we already discussed INTENSIVELY, a good name for the fridge...thing is our highest priority. I am happy to announce, that we do have a name now.
            <br><br>
            Of course, we decided this on a democratic vote, with...professional advice. Suffice to say, I appreciate the dedication and spirit everyone brought to the board, we only had to call the ambulance twice today, what a good stat to add to our new promotional board!
            <br><br>
            Enough of my leadup though, I am sure you all are hungry for the final vote:

            ✧✧ Penny-Cilla ✧✧
        </h1>
        <p>
            Thanks you generous brainstorming and voting, we have now a name for our new product: Expansion and experimentation will of course be outsourced to project offices, and internal marketing has officially begun.
            <br><br>
            With regards,<br>
            CMO
