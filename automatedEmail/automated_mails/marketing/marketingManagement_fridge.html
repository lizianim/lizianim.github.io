        <p>
            fellows,<br>
            We have seen it all!<br>
            It is written everywhere!
            <br><br>
            We are currently in direct conversations with CMO, offices and associates!
            <br><br>
            I might have lost my fingers, but not my will to capitalize, so we got to work to give YOU a running start: The fridge organism will be our new SALES strategy!
            <br><br>
            The company has waited too long for an opportunity, so it was my DUTY to take it into my non-existing hands now: The other offices might disagree - but what accounting refuses to do and project is too hesitant to admit, we make into action.
            <br><br>
            Is it ethical? What a question, ask yourself: Are you ethical as a being?<br>
            Is it profitable? It is a stake, but a welcome one in THIS ECONOMY.<br>
            Is it worth it? Read through the first two questions, and there is the answer:
        </p>
        <h1>
            YES. YES.<br>
            YES!
        </h1>
        <p>
            We don't hesitate. We are the ones making the big shots.<br>
            We are the marketing!
            <br><br>
            Fellows, this is important: CMO is again only sending out the namesake on request: please refer to it in high importance, so their importance is not undermined by other important marketing executive affairs.
            <br><br>
            your fellow marketer and market knower,<br>
            Marketing management.
