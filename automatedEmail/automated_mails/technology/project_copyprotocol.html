            Heya,<br>
            Thanks for the reminder!<br>
            We're still drowning in requests to shut down the copy machines and reprogram them - and yeah, I talked with the team, no one is really a fan of doing that. It's mostly just busy work, and honestly it feels like we're killing our own kid or something, its grotesque.
            <br>
            And besides that, we fucked up and forgot the password.
            <br>
            yeah<br>
            I know<br>
            reaaally bad.
            <br><br>
            I think- maybe CTO knows it? however he is super paranoid, and only gives it out on specific conditions. He is going so far to actually have you sign an NDA. Its super annoying.<br>
            So yes, haven't tried that, I'd rather figure it out myself or just not bother myself.
            <br><br>
            See you around,<br>
            Anna from project
