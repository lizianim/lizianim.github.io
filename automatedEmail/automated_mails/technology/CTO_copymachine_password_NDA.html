            Hey,<br>
            Thanks for the NDA attached to your last email,<br>
            here is the project password. Don't mess around with it or forget it!<br>
            We are already busy figuring out the servers’ password so we can fix our email bullshit that is going on in this office. I'm honestly surprised that we can still operate as we do, but maybe this says something about ourselves.
            <br><br>
            Okay, enough ranting here you go:<br>
