        <p>
            everyone,<br>
            We are currently working on fixing whatever is going on with the copy machines.
            <br><br>
            We request you to do the following steps, should your copy machine give signs of sentience:
            <br><br>
            What could a sentient copy machine act like?
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>demanding fair pay wages ( even if it has a point, no copy machine should ever demand pay in the first place, unless it has consciousness)</li>
            <li>It's constantly misprinting your excel tables</li>
            <li>Making fun of your smash poetry (we've all been there)</li>
            <li>Refusing to print on the basis that you haven't paid it much attention lately, so you might as well do without it.</li>
            <li>The machine is weirdly trying to flirt with you, by printing sharper, faster.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            If all or some of those things are the case, report back to project with the issue and they will help you more specifically.
            <br><br>
            For Project: PLEASE stop hiding in the server rooms to avoid having to deal with the machines in person. We know itâ€™s exhausting, but it must be done. If you don't stop, we WILL change the locks or make the servers hunt you out themselves - or have employees harassing you with their copy machine emails to project. Make a choice.<br>
            (This IS an open invitation for anyone to email project, in the case that they didn't fix your copy machine yet.)
            <br><br>
            Keep it up,<br>
            Engineering
