            Heya,<br>
            Listen we know that HR is not happy that we keep our emails informal, but also, we really don't care.
            <br><br>
            If you get THIS email, this means you are experiencing some weird shit with the copy machines.<br>
            We get that, it’s scary and all but really it's annoying more than anything. For now, we will try to reconfigure the machines but honestly it might be even better to just ... give these machines better wages??? Some basic respect ???<br>
            Let’s keep it this way: We worked our asses off for these algorithms AND we set everything up, why should we just...destroy everything we worked on?<br>
            Maybe the copy machine is not that bad but can help us make sense of this office FOR ONCE.
            <br><br>
            In any case.<br>
            We will of course look at the machine, so don't worry, delete this email and we will swing by. 
            <br><br>
            See you around,<br>
            Anna from project
            <br><br>
            Oh also, Erica: Thanks for the mint tea, this one is really hitting it. However, can you send me a reminder for the copy protocol?<br>
            I don't wanna miss sending out the internals. Again.<br>
            Cheers!
