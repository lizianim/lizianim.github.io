            Hey,<br>
            Forget it, I will not send you the password via email.<br>
            At least, not like this.
            <br><br>
            Sign that NDA, so at least Planning can get off my ass IF something goes wrong. We're already strained since the lawsuit - who of you guys did that again? I'm not saying you're wrong, but its annoying dealing with this. And my office isn't even close to theirs.
            <br><br>
            Here is the NDA to sign, attach it, and you will get the password.
            <br><br>
            Good luck,<br>
            CTO
