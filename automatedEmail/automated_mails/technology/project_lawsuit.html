            Heya,
            <br><br>
            Planning is probably fuming and ready to throw some bricks, but honestly this just makes it more hilarious.
            <br><br>
            So, imagine us standing opposite to each otherâ€™s floors, us throwing watercoolers, them throwing bricks. Considering the circumstances, I am having fun with this.
            <br><br>
            What's not fun though is planning to drag our hot drink choices through the mud or acting like we are the only ones to blame.
            <br><br>
            Listen, this office is boring, and we sometimes really don't have anything better to do than mess with planning. It's easy to do, they react always, and it might be unhealthy but it keeps us sane. HOWEVER. They always flex with their stupid fancy watercoolers, and we decided to have a little fun and complain.
            <br><br>
            And we may have bricked their coolers and made them virtually unusable.<br>
            Does that warrant them going berserk and kicking in two project members teeth and fractures? I don't think so. (Don't worry though, we made sure to give them some bitemarks. We are not without defenses).
            <br><br>
            Thats all. That's about it. There is nothing deeper going on, and we are just a bunch of incredibly bored nerds that want to spice up this boring office.
            <br><br>
            And we will do it again, so suck it planning.
            <br><br>
            See you around,<br>
            Anna from Project
