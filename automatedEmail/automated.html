            <h4>This Email is automated. [2023]</h4>
            <p class="subhead">Play-By-Email Game</p>
            <p>
                As a new office worker at "Sparecorp Incorporated Inc." the player is tasked with navigating the confusing network of automated office emails, trying to find their way to the boss's office.
                <br><br>
                "This Email is automated." uses the Microsoft software "Outlook" to deconstruct the inner workings of automated emails, their history and our cultural understanding of messages sent by the machine.
                This story builds a speculative reality, in which an office is primarily communicating between email servers instead of people.
                How do these tools shape the way we communicate? How do these tools determine our relationship to each other?
                With these questions in mind, the game reshapes the way Outlook is used, and implements it's flaws and features into the gameplay.
