            <h4>Lisa Ziebermayr</h4>
            <p>
                Currently studying @ <a href="https://www.artez.nl/en/courses/bachelor/design-art-technology">Design Art Technology</a> ArtEZ, Arnhem.

            <p>
                With a formal background in Graphic Design, I decided to expand my artistic practice to a deeper focus in human / technology interaction and artistic research through a multi-media approach.
            </p>
            <p>
                In my practice I investigate technology and material, and work with their artifacts to create a narrative with and about their systems.

                In real life, I stare at the sky and like to find interesting corners in my peripheral vision (when I'm not watching the stars).
