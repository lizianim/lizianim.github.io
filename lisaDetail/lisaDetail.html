            <h4>Lisa Ziebermayr</h4>
            <p>
                Currently studying @ <a href="https://www.artez.nl/en/courses/bachelor/design-art-technology">Design Art Technology</a> ArtEZ, Arnhem.
                <br><br>
                With a formal background in graphic design, I decided to expand my skillset technically as well as conceptually in Art School, with a deeper focus in technology and digital phenomena.
                <br><br>
                In my work I take a closer  look at how society shapes technology, how it shapes us in return, as well as the consequences these developments bring with them.
                <br><br>
                I don't work with one specified medium alone, but rather I investigate different technological developments, discover its manifestations and work with these to create a narrative with and about these systems. 
                <br><br>
                These investigations encourage me to be aware of the flaws and features of certain tools, why they have been built, and how they change us in return. The expansion of my toolset is a welcome bonus, and allows me to take greater risks, to investigate with curiosity as well as mindfulness as to how I engage with them in my practice.
