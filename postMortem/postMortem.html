            <h4>POST MORTEM DIGITUS [2023]</h4>
            <p class="subhead">speculative archive</p>

                Scanned Photoalbums, saved screenshots, childhood recordings and many more relics saved digitally are assumed to last forever - or at least longer than its physical counterpart.
                However, ordinary Harddrives have an approximate 3 - 5 years lifespan.  The cloud is promising us endless storage and time, but it too is constructed out of servers and hardware: We demand immortality from these machines, but have we ever found a way to truly preserve fragile memory?
            </p>
            <p>
                Post Mortem Digitus proposes a speculative future, in which the death of a Harddrive is examined, determined and dissected: By investigating the dead we can understand the living, by taking a look at the mortal remains the memory seems immortal.
