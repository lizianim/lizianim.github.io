            <h4>POST MORTEM DIGITUS [2023]</h4>

                Digitally recorded artefacts are assumed to last longer than their physical counterparts - we expect the to be conveniently stored forever. What goes ignored is the fact that ordinary Harddisks have an approximate 3 -5 year lifespan. The cloud might promise us endless storage and time, but it too is constructed out of fragile hardware: We demand immortality from these systems, but have we ever found a way to truly preserve our fragile memory?
            </p>
            <p>
                Post Mortem Digitus proposes a speculative future in which the death of a Harddisk is examined and dissected: By investigating the dead we can understand the living, by taking a look at the mortal remains the memory seems immortal.
