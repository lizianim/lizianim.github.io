            Stuck in an endless cycle,
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <p>I feel you taking my veins like poison, numbing my every thought and then I leave into a place I shouldn't see.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <p>An inner death, like something is deeply wrong, everything hurting, to rip my flesh from my bones when in truth</p>
        <p>there was silence</p>
        <p>nerve wracking silence.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <p>
            but why<br>
            <br>
            do I loathe the one I have to spend eternity with?
