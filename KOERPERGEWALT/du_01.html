    <div>
        <p>I can feel it as well.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
    <p>It has been for a very long time, I fear.</p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <p>
            No one should see me like this, but I hate hiding it.<br>
            I feel like I am dying,<br>
            slowly degrading,<br>
            <br>
            falling into my pieces, never to be put together again.
        </p>
    </div>

    <div>
        <p>
            An inner death, like something is deeply wrong.<br>
            everything hunting you to rip your flesh from your bones, when in truth there is silence.
        </p>
    </div>
