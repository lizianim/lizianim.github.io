                We often return to things to understand the world around us, what we are and what is happening to us. What also happens, is that there is no way back, and no way forward if we are caught in an infinite loop of overthinking.

                The work explores themes of regret and blame through a hypertext narrative, in which the basic functions of the site are restricted to one action only: trying to refresh the page, cycling through the past. It traps both itself and the viewer in a cycle of repetition, without a destination.
