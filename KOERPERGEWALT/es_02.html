<div>
    <p>
        maaaaakes sense?<br>
        Please
    </p>

    <p>
        Look at you<br>
        Do you think I'm doing this?
    </p>

    <p>
        Do you not understand<br>
        that<br>
        all<br>
        this here
    </p>

    <p>
        is a reaction.<br>
        Both of you are too proud, too selfish to see
    </p>

    <p>
        You are not invincible.<br>
        Neither am I<br>
        Neither is the universe.
    </p>

    <p>You are nothing but you.</p>
</div>

<div>
    <p>You do?</p>
</div>

<div>
    <p>Of yourse you never did, you never act.</p>
</div>

<div>
    <p>What do you mean</p>
</div>

<div>
    <p>
        ALL YOU WANT IS BLOOD ON YOUR FINGERS.<br>
        Your claws slowly sinking into anything that comes your way because YOU THINK YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO.
    </p>

    <p>How long can you bite your tongue until it falls out and you bleed over everyone near you.</p>

    <p>I know what you dream of.</p>

    <p>To destroy your current self, slashing her open, seeing her bleed, to at least justify this misery.</p>
</div>
