                It's not a big space, and there is not much use for it. It is right next to the Apartments which are attached to the covered side entrance of the school. I never saw it,  and I never recognized it. But the more I come in contact with it, the more it irritates me. It is not covered, it is just an elevated floor, not square, not that useful if you want to move your bike. The stones pointing out the elevation are broken, some of them missing, many too loose to call it a sturdy structure. The wood on the sides of the bike storage is rotten, it peels away. Plants take over the structure, more than anything else in the storage area. the path opens to something like a courtyard, but this as well is a light opening for the windowed apartments at best, a strange mutation at worst. There are stairs no one is using anymore, the windows face each other or the walls of the courtyard. Everything is isolated to itself, and this tiny corner represents this isolation at its core, <a href="./where.html">moment you enter.</a>
