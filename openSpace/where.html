            <h4>Where does it come from?</h4>
            <p>
                The Gelders Archief has about seven architectural plans of the school, and ten of the neighbourhood it is located in.
                <br><br>
                It is 1904. Plans for the school are made. Everything grows into a specific function: Every room has its designation. The important rooms are outlined, the descriptions carefully noted. Everything, even the empty space.
                <br><br>
                Its marked in only two of the documents; it has a name in only one. 
                <br><br>
                "Open Plaats" - Open Place, Open Space, Open location. A cartographer makes notes so the constructions can be accurate. These names are set on paper, setting into place what this space is going to be - for us, and for reality. But what is an "Open space"? Is it free for use? Is it a few sqare meters that happen to be open? Why specifically this space? 
                <br><br>
                It is interesting that the storage, the open space, they still exist as they were, on a map in 1904. What is different, is that back then, the kitchen building had a south-west window and door.
                <br><br>
                Here it made sense to create an "open space". There was a space needed to enter - and exit. Why the "walkway" just didn't extend - who knows. Maybe it was more pleasing to the eyes of the architect. Maybe the kitchen needed an elevated platform for the south-west door.
                <br><br>
                The "Rywelen bergplaats" is still a bike storage, the "keuken" is still a kitchen (if you sneak a peek, you see a sink) and the "open plaats" - is still open. But what changed, is that the door to the kitchen is gone. It vanished. It is another window, looking at the forgotten fence piece. You occasionally get a glimpse at construction racks, the building is so old it needs constant maintenance.
                <br><br>
                With all this history, its surprising this emptyness had a name all along. from the beginning of the school, until now, it still owns it, and perhaps serves its name even more: Open space: free for all,<a href="./oncethought.html">unseen by everyone.</a>
