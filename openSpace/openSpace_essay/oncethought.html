                Ian Reid wrote in his book "I am thinking of ending things" the following lines:
            </p>
            <p class="quote">
                Once this thought arrives, it stays. It sticks. It lingers. It dominates. There's not much I can do about it. Trust me. It doesn't go away. It's there whether I like it or not. It's there when I eat. When I go to bed. It's there when I sleep. It's there when I wake up. It's always there.
                Always.

                This is what the "Open space" has been doing to me for the past weeks. Perhaps, its more what it represents to me: The uneasy isolation from defined structures, lived spaces. It speaks a language so quiet I have to come closer to try and understand, but all I hear is silence. It never asks for a response. It only speaks because it is here, and once you see it - you can hear it.

                Maybe it has always fulfilled its function as the name implies. "Open Space" was a gateway, a necessity, something to accommodate something else. But now, it has no reason to accommodate. Its just an awkward spot, rendered as such through meticulous planning of the space around it, and now the only memory of a structure changing with time - maybe for us to recognize time passing,<a href="./digitalmap.html">there need to be things never changing.</a>
