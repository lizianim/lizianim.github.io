                The initial reaction was to map specifically places that seem out of place. Public access but being the unwanted when accessed. It was about the feeling that arises, when you enter these spaces and where these spaces are located.
                <br><br>
                Giving feelings words is never easy, but this in particular is one felt in specific intervals in a specific place. You know it when you get there. You almost forget about it when you come home. 
                <br><br>
                It's unwelcome, but inviting you in. It's isolation, but you feel watched everywhere. No one is going to disturb you, but you constantly fear someone will know where you are.
                <br><br>
                If I get asked "where have you been" this is the last place I would answer with. It's not JUST a parking lot or a weird corner in the bike storage.  It belongs to me, the feeling, and the real world all the same; but when I am gone, this place virtually no longer exists.
                <br><br>
                So how do you map such a specific moment in your life? How do you grasp the spacial logic at its core and say "this is where it is happening, that is the direction to that place".

                It helps recognizing, that Geography is not only about how far away something is relation to us. It is an approximation and experience all the same. "Geographies of Digital Exclusion" phrases it this way:
            </p>
            <p class="quote">
                "Geography is location. It is interconnections, flows and networks. It is both materiality and discourse. It is grounded, but in flux. It has a multiplicity of histories and futures. It is local, global and relational. It is space and time. It is undergoing continual augmentation by the anthroposphere. It is made up of memory and imagination. It is a platform and a process. It both shapes and is shaped by geometries of power. It is experienced, produced and continuously brought into being. "
            </p>
            <p>and finally:</p>
            <p class="quote">
                "At the end of the day, we care about geography because we care about the world: the environmental, economic, social and political contexts, ecosystems and networks that we are embedded in. We care about how things work, how things are represented and the relationships between those things."

                Geography in essence was never about how long a river stretches between land, and how many curves it has. It's about the way the water separates the riverbanks, how the water draws us in, inevitably making us think about us and <a href="./arealplace.html">our environment.</a>
