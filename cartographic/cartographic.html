                A map is not only a recollection of reality.
                It depicts a specific time and place.<br>
                Architectural sketches are fiction manifested in the inbetween,
                not yet realized structure.
                <br><br>
                These cartographic architectural sketches depict the listening experience
                of the ArtEZ Library Archive: ignored and unknown by most.
                The annotations and markings from the sound recordings, done on the
                10th of November 2023, were analyzed with a Spectogram and applied on the maps.
                <br><br>
                By using lowpass/highpass filters and recontextualizing them,
                the archive becomes an imagined sound reality beyond its own accoustics.
